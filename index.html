            <p>I know his face is cute but trust me when I say all he will do is eat your cords. Everything you own. Nothing is safe. You own statues? Gone. Flowers? Gone. 
                Nothing is sacred to him and he cannot, no, will not be stopped. He will steal from you in the dead of night. You think you're allowed to sleep? 
                No, you could never be allowed something so heinous as a good nights rest in his presence.</p>
